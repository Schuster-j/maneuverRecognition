    "ManeuverRecognition is a python package which provides functions for the preprocessing of time series data, the creation of predictive LSTM based classification models and the evaluation of multi class predictions. In this repository its functionalities are demonstrated using a real world use case in the domain of vehicle telematics (section 2). Also the package documentation is provided (section 3).\n",

    "A more detailed research paper is also available here: ManeuverRecognition - a python package for timeseries classification in the domain of vehicle telematics\n",
    "*Abstract - In the domain of vehicle telematics the automated recognition of driving maneuvers is used to classify and evaluate driving behaviour and situations in traffic. This not only serves to enhance the personalization of insurance policies, but also to increase road safety, reduce accidents and the associated costs as well as to reduce fuel consumption and support environmentally friendly driving. In this context maneuver recognition technically requires a continuous application of time series classification which poses special challenges to the preprocessing of telematic sensor data, the training of predictive models, and the prediction itself. Although much research has been done in the field of gathering relevant data or the methods to build predictive models for the task of maneuver recognition, there is a need for python packages and functions that allow quickly transforming data into the required structure as well as to build and evaluate such models. The ManeuverRecognition package was therefore developed to provide the necessary functions for preprocessing, modelling and evaluation and also includes a ready to use LSTM based network structure that can be modified. The application of the package is demonstrated using real driving data of three different persons recorded via smartphone sensors.*"

    "The dataset contains sensor data of a smartphones accelerometer, gyroscope and GPS which were recorded during a total of three trips driven by different persons using different vehicles on the same 60.7 kilometer route. The accelerometer was used to record the acceleration forces along three orthogonal axes in meters per square second without taking the gravitational force into account. The gyroscope was used to measure rotational speed around the same three axes in radians per second. GPS data includes latitude, longitude, altitude, accuracy as an estimated horizontal accuracy radius in meters, and speed in meters per second. The following picture shows the positioning of the smartphone during the recordings and the resulting alignment of the sensors axes.\n",

In addition to the maneuver type there is also the variable maneuver element which represents a more refined category system. The variables of smartphone data include datetime, the accelerometer and gyroscope sensor variables per axes, as well as GPS information such as longitude, latitude, altitude, accuracy and speed."

Although the road type was also manually labeled it can be used since the road type of new driving data could be accessed by matching the GPS coordinates with publicly available road data. In order to use the categorical variable road type it will first be converted into dummy variables. To prevent mixing the data of the three different persons when executing a rolling windowing function in the preprocessing the data of the three persons will be split and recombined afterwards."

    "Our goal is to create a model which can correctly identify driving maneuvers in unknown data of future driving records. Therefore, to train the model, we cannot simply use the individual maneuvers already assigned to their IDs, but have to use a rolling window to create training and testing cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do that, we are in need of two specific functions:\n",
    "1. A windowing function that gets our data and returns windows with a specific amount of time steps and a specific step size between those windows in the shape of (cases, timesteps, variables).\n",
    "2. A function to split the data into training and testing data before the windowing is applied. If we do not split training and testing data before using the windowing function, there will be data leakage because overlapping windows may end up in both partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose we can use the timeseries_train_test_split function in the preprocessing module. It first splits the given dataframe in an arbitrary number of partitions. Then it randomly selects some of these partitions in regard to our test size and removes them from a copy of the full dataframe. The remaining data will be used for training. We can also use this function to apply a robust scaling which will use the training data for fitting the scaler. The windowing function will then be applied on the training and testing partitions separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this approach, it can still happen occasionally that we create unnatural transitions between maneuvers that occurred before and after the partitions we cut out for the test data or that we break some maneuvers. However, the amount of it which depends on the number of splits we use will be negligible, as it is clearly more important that we have absolutely no data leakage. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following parameters can be configured:\n",
    "- splits: Number of random partitions in which data will be separated before windowing will be applied.\n",
    "- test_size: Proportion of data to use for testing.\n",
    "- time_steps: Length of windows in number of rows.\n",
    "- step_size: Steps between windows in number of rows.\n",
    "- scale: Bool whether we apply robust scaling or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have data of three different persons and to ensure that different route segments of the trips can appear in the training and test data we will apply the timeseries_train_test_split function on each individual dataset and combine the windowed data subsequently. Our windows will have a length of 14 timesteps which is 7 seconds in our dataset and we will use a stepsize of 6 timesteps which equals 3 seconds. We then merge the data, with every window seperated and already in the right shape."

    "In order to evaluate the performance of our model, we can use the function predict() from the modelling module with our test data and then compare the predicted with the actual values. The already created encoding object which inherits the label_encoder can be used to access the perviously encoded class labels and apply the inverse_transform() function of the label_encoder to turn the y values into the original class labels for comparison. With these class labels and the inverse transformed y_test and y_pred data we can use the confusion_heatmap() function of the evaluation module to plot the comparison of actual and predicted values.\n",

    "Since we have an unbalanced multi-class use case, and the color intensity of this regular heatmap takes all fields into account, the distribution should instead be inspected row or column wise which can be done by using the recall_heatmap (row wise) or precision_heatmap (column wise) functions. In this way we can inspect the proportion of correctly classified values for each class separately in regard to whether a specific class was predicted (precision_heatmap) or a case of a specific class is given (recall_heatmap)."
